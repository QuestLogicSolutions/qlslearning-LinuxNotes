Account Management

There are three types of user in linux: - root, regular and service.

Username is flexible. It can be changed as per requirement. Regardless it is selected first time or changed later; it must be unique in system. Two users can’t use the same username.

UID is fixed. It cannot be changed. Once assigned, it always remains the same for that user account.

Original file name	  passwd	shadow	group	   gshadow
Backup file name	    passwd-	shadow-	group-	 gshadow-



# cat /etc/passwd
The full account info is stored in /etc/passwd in the following format:
[username]:[x]:[UID]:[GID]:[Comment]:[Home directory]:[default shell]
x indicates that the account is protected by a shadow password.

# cat /etc/groups
[GroupName]:[GroupPasswd]:[GID]:[GroupMembers]
x in GroupPasswd indicates group password isn't being used.
Group members are listed in a comma separated value

# cat /etc/shadow <-- contains password and account expiration info. Looks like this:

- username
- encrypted password
- # of days since 01/01/1970 since passwd was last changed
- # of days before password can be changed. 0 means it can be changed anytime.
- # of days after which password must be changed. 99999 means it can be unchaged for a long time
- # of days to warn user of expiring password. 7 for a full week.
- # of days after password expires that acct is disabled
- reserved for possible future use


# id - display user and group ID
# useradd, usermod, userdel - add, modify, delete user accounts
# groupadd, groupmod, groupdel - add modify, delete groups
# gpasswd - utility for administering /etc/group config file
# pwck, grpck - utilities to manage verification of password, group & associated shadow files
# pmconv, pwuconv - convert password to shadow passwords and vice versa
# grpconv, grpunconv - convert shadowed info for group accounts


After a user account is created, the useradd command kicks off the following:
1) home directory is created in /home/username (this is the default location)
2) hidden files are copied into user's home directory to provide environmental variables
  - .bash_logout
  - .bash_profile
  - .bashrc - created in user's home directory
3) a mail spool is created at /var/spool/mail/username
4) a group is created w/ the same name as he user account
